# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a simple, interactive, command-line based game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated secret number. The difficulty level selected by the user determines the allowed number of attempts and the range of the secret number. The project demonstrates functional programming concepts, user input handling, control flow, and basic logic implementation in Python.

## Scope of the Project
This project focuses on implementing a lightweight yet functional game that runs in a terminal environment. It is designed to showcase understanding of:
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Input/output handling
- Random number generation
- Program structuring and user interaction

The scope includes:
- Three levels of difficulty
- Random number generation
- Input validation through game logic
- Real-time feedback on attempts (win or lose)

## Target Users
This game is intended for:
- Beginners learning Python programming
- Students participating in foundational computer science courses
- Anyone who enjoys simple number-based guessing games
- Educators demonstrating basic programming constructs

## High-Level Features
- Three selectable difficulty levels:
  - **Easy (1–10, unlimited attempts)**
  - **Medium (1–50, 7 attempts)**
  - **Hard (1–100, 5 attempts)**
- Randomized secret number generation
- Attempt counter and result display
- Terminal-based interface
- Simple, clean flow of gameplay
